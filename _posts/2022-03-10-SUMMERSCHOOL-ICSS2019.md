#### Useful to know about Day 1

***The ice breaker game***  
The afternoon was animated by Ákos Wetters. Akos offered an app for an Ice Breaker game called [SpotYet](https://www.spotyet.com/). 
We had to take a selfie and answer questions about ourselves. 
Then, the app showed us the picture of the person we had to talk to and after finding the person, we could talk about our answers or about anything else we fancied. 
It gave us the possibility to have one on one conversation instead of having to introduce ourselves in front of 60 other persons.  
Here is a map of our interconnection during the event made by SpotYet.
