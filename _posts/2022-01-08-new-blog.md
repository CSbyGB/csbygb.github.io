title: Welcome to my new Blog

After a few years with Wordpress I decided to move to GitHub Pages and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  

## New Blog but same old spirit

Even though this is a big change, the spirit of the blog stays the same:

- I will share resources about Pentest and Cybersecurity in general
- I will continue to share about my journey in this exciting world
- You will even see Posts from my previous blog here like for example the list of communities for women in cyber and tech and the list of resources.
- I will also add my previous podcast

## Want to know how I moved my blog?

- This [Blog](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) post by Jonathan McGlone did the trick!
- See [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) how to install Jekyll
- See [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) the structure for Jekyll

I hope you will enjoy it as much as I enjoy bringing this content to you!
