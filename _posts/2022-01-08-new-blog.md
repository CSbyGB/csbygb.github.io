After a few years with Wordpress I decided to move to GitHub Pages and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
Even though this is a big change, the spirit of the blog stays the same:

- I will share resources about Pentest and Cybersecurity in general
- I will continue to share about my journey in this exciting world
- You will even see Posts from my previous blog here like for example the list of communities for women in cyber and tech and the list of resources.

I hope you will enjoy it as much as I enjoy bringing this content to you!
